## Thesis: myMedicalKit: Design, Development, and Implementation of the Device and Database Management system
The "myMedicalKit" system assists users in remembering medication intake throughout the day. Comprising a smartphone app, a medical box, and a device-side app, the system streamlines medication management.
1. **Smartphone App:** Developed for iOS, it enables family-wide medication monitoring, notification messages, pharmacy search, and device information management.
2. **Device:** A compact medical box with automated drawers, an LCD screen, buttons, and an active buzzer for medication intake notification.
3. **Device-side App:** Developed for the ESP32 controller, it automates drawer control, displays administration details, activates the buzzer, and communicates with the smartphone app.

Market analysis confirmed the system's innovation. Future features include QR code medication loading and Siri control for voice commands, enhancing autonomy and simplicity in medication management, aligned with evolving regulatory requirements.
